# Encoder_7SegDisp_Keypad
This code is developed to integrate a simple mechatronics project using quadrature encoder, three of 7 segment display, and 3 x 4 matrix keypad. 

# quadrature encoder
The quadrature encoder is attached to the flywheel and motor, which gives analog outputs of phase A and B. 
The encoder module reads the signals and counts as pulse/rev.  

# 7 segment display
The 7 segment displays are three in total. They represent the decimal numbers such as ones, tens, and one-hundreds, which can represent 360 degrees. 

# 3 x 4 matrix keypad
The 3 x 4 matrix keypad is used to control which display mode is being selected and it accepts the numbers for initialization.
